                <h1 class="title">What is Philosophy?</h1>
                <p class="meaning">Philosophy literally means "love of wisdom." In a broad sense, philosophy is an activity in which people seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves, the world in which they live, and their relationships to the world and to one another. Philosophy, as an academic discipline, is very similar. Philosophers are constantly asking, answering, and arguing for their answers to life's most fundamental questions. Academic philosophy is traditionally divided into major areas of study to make such a pursuit more systematic.</p>

                    <h3>Methaphysics</h3>
                    <p>At its core the study of metaphysics is the study of the nature of reality, of what exists in the world, what it is like, and how it is ordered. In metaphysics philosophers wrestle with such questions as:</p>
                    <ul class="topic_list">
                        <li>Is there a God?</li>
                        <li>What is truth?</li>
                        <li>What is a person? What makes a person the same through time?</li>
                        <li>Is the world strictly composed of matter?</li>
                        <li>Do people have minds? If so, how is the mind related to the body?</li>
                        <li>Do people have free wills?</li>
                        <li>What is it for one event to cause another?</li>

                    <h3>Epistemology</h3>
                    <p>Epistemology is the study of knowledge. It is primarily concerned with what we can know about the world and how we can know it. Typical questions of concern in epistemology are:</p>
                    <ul class="topic_list">
                        <li>What is knowledge?</li>

                        <li>How do we know what we know?</li>
                        <li>Can we be justified in claiming to know certain things?</li>

                    <h3>Ethics</h3>
                    <p>The study of ethics frequently focuses on what we should do and what is best to do. As we wrestle with this issue, larger questions about what is good and right emerge. As a result, the ethicist tries to answer questions like:</p>
                    <ul class="topic_list">
                        <li>What is good? What makes actions or people good?</li>
                        <li>What is right? What makes actions right?</li>
                        <li>Is morality objective or subjective?</li>
                        <li>How should I treat others?</li>

                    <h3>Logic</h3>
                    <p>Another important aspect of philosophical study is the arguments or reasons given for peopleâ€TMs responses to these questions. To that end, philosophers use logic to investigate the nature and structure of arguments. Logicians ask questions like:</p>
                    <ul class="topic_list">
                        <li>What constitutes "good" or "bad" reasoning?</li>
                        <li>How do we determine whether a given piece of reasoning is good or bad?</li>

                    <h3>History of Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>The study of philosophy entails not only developing one's own answers to such questions, but also attempting to comprehend how people have answered such questions in the past. As a result, a significant part of philosophy is its history, a history of answers and arguments concerning these very questions. When studying the history of philosophy, one investigates the ideas of historical figures such as:</p>

                    <p>The study of philosophy is frequently motivated not by the answers or arguments themselves, but by whether or not the arguments are good and the answers are true. Furthermore, many of the questions and issues raised in the various branches of philosophy overlap and, in some cases, converge. As a result, philosophical issues arise in almost every discipline. As a result, philosophy includes topics such as:</p>
